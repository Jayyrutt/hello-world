1/9 Homework 
What is SLDC- framework that describes the activities performed at each stage of a software development project
The two major types of the SDLC are Waterfall and Agile
Waterfall Strengths
Waterfall is the oldest and most- known SLDC model
Very well kept records that allow programs to be improved in the future
Customer knows what to expect- time budget and also the size of the project
Waterfall Weaknesses
Once a step is completed, it cannot be changed
If an error is found, the project will have to be started from the beginning
Does not take in the customers evolving needs- if changes need to be made it could affect time and budget
Agile Strengths
Allows changes after initial planning
Easier to add features and feedback so the customers get what they ultimately desire and keep up with the industry
Bugs and errors can be caught in the development cycle because it allows you to test thoroughly as the project is being built
Agile Weaknesses
Initial project does not have definitive plan
Final product can be different that what expected
Project can become mismanaged and underdeveloped because of it being rush effectively changing time and budget
 
Both the Agile and waterfall methodologies have their strengths and weaknesses. The key to deciding which is right for you comes down to the context of the project. Is it going to be changing rapidly? If so, choose Agile. Do you know exactly what you need? Good. Then maybe waterfall is the better option. Or better yet? Consider taking aspects of both methodologies and combining them in order to make the best possible software development process for your project.
