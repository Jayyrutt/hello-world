Agile V. Waterfall
Agile- promise to aggressively build apps by showing them everything possible 
          deliver app in a visible term as much as possible
          constant changes from customer affecting cost and budget
Waterfall- very linear, customer will not see app until finished
                 all requirements are known and set in stone so the customer will know        what they are getting from the beginning till the end
  Most customers don't know what they want so they will use agile most often
   Must be able to communicate the differences between Agile and Waterfall
